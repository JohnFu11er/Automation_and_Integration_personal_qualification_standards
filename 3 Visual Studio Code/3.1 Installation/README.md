<h1><u>Installation of Visual Studio Code</u></h1>


<h1>We are going to get started by first installing VSCode</h1>

-Installing VSCode
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux

NOTE: Install the ansible, yaml, jinja2, and gitlens addons. 
They'll make your life easier. There are many more addons, but no 
need to add a bunch we may not use.

Encourage you try add ons at your leisure though.
